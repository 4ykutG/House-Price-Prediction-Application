House Price Prediction Application
This project is a House Price Prediction Application developed using Python and machine learning techniques. The application uses the Random Forest algorithm to predict the selling price of houses based on various features (such as location, number of rooms, area in square meters, building age, etc.).

Features
Predicts house prices based on input features from the dataset.

Utilizes Random Forest Regressor for modeling.

Built with popular Python libraries for easy usage.

Allows evaluation of model performance with test data.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

scikit-learn

pandas

numpy

matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

jupyter notebook (optional, for demo purposes)

Installation & Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/4ykutG/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
Install required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

Start with the main Python file:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Or open House_Price_Prediction.ipynb with Jupyter Notebook.

Test with your own data:
After training, you can input custom house features to see the predicted price.

About the Model
The model is trained on a housing dataset and can predict prices based on user input.

Random Forest combines the output of multiple decision trees for robust and accurate predictions and is resistant to overfitting.
